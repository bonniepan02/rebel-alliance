# Authentication

Authentication is when an entity proves an identity. Authentication proves correct identity.

# Authorization

Authorization is when an entity proves a right to access(allowing certain action).

# Single Sign-on (SSO)

Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials.

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular, between an identity provider and a service provider. The single most important use case is single sign-on (SSO), for logging users into applications based on their sessions in another context. This single sign-on (SSO) login standard has significant advantages over logging in using a username/password. SAML SSO works by transferring the userâ€™s identity from one place (the identity provider) to another (the service provider). This is done through an exchange of digitally signed XML documents.

Central Authentication Service (CAS) is a simple and powerful ticket-based protocol supporting SSO for the web.

# Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

MFA is a method of logon verification where at least two different factors of proof are required. MFA helps keep protect your data or assets by adding an extra layer of security.
There are 3 recognized types of authentication factors:

Type 1: Something you know
Type 2: Something you have
Type 3: Something you are
