PEP: python enhancement proposal. A PEP is a design doc providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes or environment. The PEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. 

A tuple is an immutable sequence of Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets. Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated values.

In basic terms, a python decorator is a callable that takes a callable as input and returns another callable. 
```
def null_decorator(func):
    return func
```

[u'String'] is a text representation of a list that contains a Unicode string on Python 2.

git grep <regex here> |awk -F: '{print $1}' | sort --uniq

A good way to view them is to think that namedtuples are a memory-efficient shortcut to defining an immutable class in Python manually.
