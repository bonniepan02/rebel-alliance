# Blameless PostMortems and Just Culture

Having a “blameless” Post-Mortem process means that engineers whose actions have contributed to an accident can give a detailed account of:

what actions they took at what time,
what effects they observed,
expectations they had,
assumptions they had made,
and their understanding of timeline of events as they occurred.
…and that they can give this detailed account without fear of punishment or retribution.

```
We must strive to understand that accidents don’t happen because people gamble and lose.
Accidents happen because the person believes that:
…what is about to happen is not possible,
…or what is about to happen has no connection to what they are doing,
…or that the possibility of getting the intended outcome is well worth whatever risk there is.
```

## A second story

This idea of digging deeper into the circumstance and environment that an engineer found themselves in is called looking for the “Second Story”. In Post-Mortem meetings, we want to find Second Stories to help understand what went wrong.

Human error is seen as cause of failure ---> Human error is seen as the effect of systemic vulnerabilities deeper inside the organization
Saying what people should have done is a satisfying way to describe failure ---> Saying what people should have done doesn’t explain why it made sense for them to do what they did
Telling people to be more careful will make the problem go away ---> only by constantly seeking out its vulnerabilities can organizations enhance safety

We accept that the Hindsight Bias will continue to cloud our assessment of past events, and work hard to eliminate it.
We accept that the Fundamental Attribution Error is also difficult to escape, so we focus on the environment and circumstances people are working in when investigating accidents.
We strive to make sure that the blunt end of the organization understands how work is actually getting done (as opposed to how they imagine it’s getting done, via Gantt charts and procedures) on the sharp end.

# Debriefing Facilitation Guide

“The purpose of an investigation is to understand how things usually
go right as a basis for explaining how things occasionally go wrong."

Most traditional accident investigation is around

```
Someone did not do something they should have, according to
someone else.
```

“Next time, do what you should.” Unfortunately, this approach does not result in the safer and improved future we want.

Adaptability and learning. We learn through honest, blameless
reflection on lessons and surprises. We believe that traditional rootcause analysis makes learning from mistakes difficult. Our blameless
post-mortem process is a widely-cited technique that we believe is
becoming best practice among organizations that value innovation.

The debriefing exists to hear (and ask about) people’s descriptions, not their explanations.
In other words: As facilitators, we are not looking for causes.

Finding cause is easy, and we don’t need a group interview to find it. In contrast, finding all the
things people actively do to keep the system running effectively is quite difficult, so an accident
provides a unique opportunity for these underlying factors to be revealed.

As facilitators, we are not looking to somehow merge these multiple perspectives into a single story.
Quite the contrary—the value in gathering multiple narratives is to ask questions that shed light on
the contrasting and complementing parts of the different accounts shared in the debriefing.

The goal is to seize the opportunity for an organization to learn as much as they can, in a relatively short period of time, about how people normally perceive and perform their work.

We believe that organizational learning from accidents comes from gathering data about the
accident, constructing a timeline, and bringing people involved into a group discussion led by
a skilled and neutral facilitator.

## Familiarize yourself with the timeline in advance

You’ll want to review this document to get an initial
idea of where the interesting communication patterns, decision points, observations, and actions
occurred so you can sketch out where to dive deeper in your debrief.

Focus on open questions—ones that don’t have “yes” or “no” answers. Make notes in the margin about what seem like important pivot points in the timeline, and jot down questions that might draw out additional context from people involved. Doing this in advance can help you stay on track and attentive during the debriefing itself.

To this end, it is important to have a dedicated note-taker.

## Setting expectations

So as the facilitator, you need to counter this most human urge to find a single explanation and
single fix for the incident. You can do this by giving a brief introduction in the debrief to remind
participants what you are all there for: a semi-structured group interview. Nothing more.

Sample introduction:

```
The goal for our time together today is to recreate the event, talking through what happened
for each person at each stage in order to create as robust a portrait as possible of what
happened, and what the circumstances in play were at each juncture (when decisions were
made, and actions were taken) that made it make sense for people to do what they did in the
moment. If one of you gains an insight into the complexity of another person’s role, this was
an hour well spent.
Throughout the duration of this debrief, we will all focus on being utterly blameless, to
ourselves and to others. We will be focusing on the HOW of what happened, not the WHY.
I’m facilitating, which means I’ll be keeping track of time, making sure we get through the
whole timeline, and asking a ton of questions. I’ve met with a few of you separately to build
a basic timeline of events which will help me keep the discussion on track. I’d like to invite
anyone else to ask questions as they arise, and chime in if you have more information or
context to add at any time. I’ll be taking notes and reconstructing out the timeline during this
meeting and will share it and my notes with all of you afterward. Who has questions?”
```

After you have established the timeline, you want to make sure everybody agrees that it is accurate
and comprehensive. This means asking the room what’s missing, if there’s anything you haven’t
talked about, or if anything happened differently than described so far.

Your next step is to pivot the conversation toward what the group learned from going through
the timeline, and to discover more perspectives that can clarify or add additional context what’s
been written down. This is also when you’d invite everyone in the room to start thinking about the
learning points from the event. These can include recommendations for remediation items, but
shouldn’t be limited to them.

## The Art of asking questions

Asking “how” enables us to hear other people’s stories. Asking “why” creates a story of our own and tends
to elicit only the evidence that supports our story.

In general, you want to ask questions that reveal:
• Cues that lead people to make observations
• Context for assessments or judgments
• Rationales for choices or decisions
• Things that people know (and might assume are common knowledge)
• People’s states of mind at the time
• Mental models for how things “should” work
• Factors that led people to take a specific action
• Signals that bring people to ask for help

## Success Metrics

We have come to think about two very basic success metrics when it comes to facilitating debriefings: the acquisition of new information that affects the future work, and attendees' willingness to participate in future debriefings.

- Did at least one person learn one thing that will affect how they work in the future?
- Did at least half of the attendees say they would attend another debrief in the future?

## Conclusion

We believe that when failures happen, we have a simple choice to make:
• Do we want to react to this failure from a place of hindsight and judgment of people’s actions
and decisions taken out of context?
• Or do we want to truly learn from the event by giving voice to the diverse perspectives and
stories of the people closest to the work?
It should be obvious at this point, but we choose the latter option.

## Other tips:

- accidents are expensive, and thus we want to maximize the learning by sharing our experiences and to avoid further erosion of trust if any
- decide who is going to facilitate the meeting
- not to waste the meeting time just reading what is in the doc out loud
- let people read before meeting or the first few minutes of the meeting and let people add comments
- make sure that empty part of the doc are either filled or marked as N/A with an explanation or deleted
- ask the room if the impact assessment is complete
- ask if the root cause if "root" enough using 5 whys
- what are the guard rails we have and what additional things we have identified and want to put them into place to prevent
- are the action items appropriate and appropriate prioritized and owned?
- who else we should share the report with?
- interview upfront and describe the event in a higher level
- If you can't see an assumption, remember everyone has preconceptions, if you can't see it, it's in one of your assumptions; what assumptions are they using, explicitly call them out and confirm they are intentional
- is the discussion going in the direction that I want (or will provide value)
- what question can I ask to steer the discussion that way
- calmly ask a question that will redirect the focus to solving the problem rather than getting upset
- emulate kids, WWMKA(what would my kid ask) practice asking dumb questions to feed curiosity, which will lead to better questions
