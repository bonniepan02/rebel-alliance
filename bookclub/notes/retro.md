# Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great

Retrospectives help teams keep improving.

You can add variety by adding new activities, but stick to this basic outline--this structure does what a retrospective needs to do.

- Set the stage
  Start with a simple welcome and appreciation for people's investment of time. Restate the purpose of the retrospective and the goal for the session. Remind people of how long you will meet. Ask everyone in the room to speak. Ask for a word or two describing a hope for the retrospective. Then outline the approach for the session. After you have established the timebox, goal, and approach, work to establish an environment where people can bring up difficult topics and have challenging conversations.
  (An XP team had named quality, simplicity, teamwork, and courage as their values.)

  Inexperienced retrospective leaders like to skip setting the stage and plow ahead into the "meat" of a retrospective. We never regret spending time setting the stage--and neither should you. Don't skip setting the stage.

- Gather data
  Gathering data creates a shared picture of what happened. Without a common picture, individuals tend to verify their own opinions and beliefs. Start with hard data: events, metrics, features or stories completed, and so forth. Creating a structured way for people to talk about feelings makes it more comfortable to raise topics that have an emotional charge.

- Generate insights
  Lead the team to examine the conditions, interactions, and patterns that contributed to their success. Investigate breakdowns and deficiencies. Look for risks and unexpected events and outcomes.

- Decide what to do
  Your primary job is to provide structure and guidance for your team to plan experiments and actions.
  One way to plan for experiments and changes is to create story cards or backlog items. Without individual commitment, people assume that "the team" will do the task, and no one does it.

- Close the retrospective
  The learnings belong to the team, and team members. "Inspect and adapt" applies to retrospectives, too.

  This structure will help your team do the following:

  - Understand different points of view.
  - Follow a natural order of thinking
  - Take a comprehensive view of the team's current methods and practices.
  - Allow the discussion to go where it needs to go, rather than predeterming the outcome.
  - Leave the retrospective with concrete action and experiments for the next iteration.

The structure gives you a tried and true process to help your team inspect and adapt.

You may even be rotaing the role among team members.

## Shaping the goal for the retrospective

A useful goal helps answer the question, what will achieve value for the time invested? Choose a broad goal that leaves open possibilities for your team to think creatively about their experiences and discover the insights that are important to them. Useful goals for retrospectives include the following:

- Find ways to improve our practices.
- Discover what we are doing well.
- Understand reasons behind missed targets.
- Find ways to improve our responsiveness to customers.
- Rebuild damaged relationships.

If the team doesn't buy into the goal, ask the team to describe a goal.

There is only so much time, so don't waste it with activities that are "just for fun." Have fun, but have a purpose.
