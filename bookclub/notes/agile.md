Agile is a small idea about the small problem of small programming teams doing small things. Big things get done by the collaboration of many small teams doing many small things.

- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity — the art of maximizing the amount of work not done — is essential.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

They represent extremely long term thinking on the part of the technical leaders. Instead of working on something that would meet a small need this week, they were laying a foundation for a fundamental shift in the way cluster software was developed. That investment has not only reaped incredible rewards at Google, but has influenced the entire industry.

My advice for people is to not focus too much on one approach to project management or development, and instead be open to different ideas and techniques. The best practices for software development are really unique to each team and each project -- there's no one size fits all solution out there. There are no absolute right answers. Any method can work given the right trade off and people.

move people around because the work isnt standardized
the work isnt standardized
language, conventions, quality bar
you cant drop into a new team and be productive in a day
because you have to learn the micro culture of that team

Agile is a framework of disciplines that support professional software development. Agile is a continuous iteration of development and testing in the software development process whereas Scrum is an Agile process to focus on delivering the business value in the shortest time. Agile methodology delivers the software on a regular basis for feedback while Scrum delivers the software after each sprint.
