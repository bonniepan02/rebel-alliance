# Make Work Visible (Exposing time theft to optimize)

## Introduction

Many of us wear our busyness as a badge of honor. In Making Work Visible, Dominica DeGrandis shows us how we can make hidden work-in-progress visible, to clearly see effect it has on our ability to get things done. Once we can see it, she dives deep into the hidden aspects of our WIP that steal our time, energy, and productivity, along with strategies for combating each of them. Making work visible helps us to take a step back from all that busyness and really see.

How do we do all that needs to get done, when it needs to get done, without sacrificing quality or our sanity in the process? In a culture that exalts productivity and perpetuates the mythology of multitasking, how do we maximize our time and our workflow to the point that our effort and our energy yields the greatest impact? Most importantly, how do we do all of that and still have time for living?

Parkinson’s Law: work expands to fill the time available for its completion.

It should come as no surprise that we can better manage what we can see. When we can’t see our work, our options are obscured. We’re blind to our own capacity and we certainly can’t communicate that capacity to others.

Our culture of overwork, our obsession with productivity versus effectiveness, our default mode of existing rather than living—these things aren’t simply unnatural and unhealthy, they’re unsustainable—for the individual, for the team, for the organization’s bottom line.

The thoughtful observations and easily implementable suggestions Dominica offers are the first step in helping create habits that lead to a virtuous cycle of healthy, sustainable, and improvable work.

Developers and testers could see the latest changes and that lack of automated testing hurt our ability to quickly spot problems.

TOC is a way to identify the most important limiting factor (the constraint) that stands in the way of achieving a goal and then systematically improving that constraint until it is no longer the limiting factor.

We intuitively knew we had too many projects in flight, but it was hard to see until we measured the actual time that it took to get work done, at which point it became obvious the work spent more time in wait states than in work states. We spent time waiting for approval.
“a strategy of flow efficiency with key principles of just-in-time and visual management.”

All it takes is a shift from haphazardly saying yes to everything to deliberately saying yes to only the most important thing at that time. And to do it visually.

The solution is to design and use a workflow system that does the following five things:

- Make work visible.
- Limit work-in-progress (WIP).
- Measure and manage the flow of work.
- Prioritize effectively.
- Make adjustments based on learnings from feedback and metrics.

As Edwards Deming said, “A bad system will beat a good person every time.”

## The Five Thieves

### Too much WIP

Who are these thieves of time? The five thieves of time that prevent you from getting work done include:

- Too Much Work-in-Progress (WIP) Work that has started, but is not yet finished. Sometimes referred to as partially completed work.
- Unknown Dependencies Something you weren’t aware of that needs to happen before you can finish.
- Unplanned Work Interruptions that prevent you from finishing something or from stopping at a better breaking point.
- Conflicting Priorities Projects and tasks that compete with each other. This is exacerbated when you are uncertain about what the most important thing is to do.
- Neglected Work Partially completed work that sits idle on the bench.

“Why do you take on more work than you have the capacity to do?”

- We are team players
- We fear humiliation “I don’t want to be criticized or fired.” Yes is easier to say than no—especially to the boss. Refusing a manager’s request can be risky in some cultures.
- We like new and shiny—It’s much more fun than doing the grunt work it takes to finish something complicated and unglamorous.
- We don’t realize how big the request is until we start working on it “Oh, no problem. I can get that done in just a couple of hours,” but the task takes much longer.
- We like to please people. “I say yes to most requests in general because I want to be liked, admired, respected. “

too much work-in-progress (WIP) is when the demand on the team exceeds the capacity of the team—which is a rather boring way to say that our teams are drowning in work, often because their schedule is completely full.

Cycle time is the amount of elapsed time that a work item spends as work-in-progress. In addition, business value that could have been realized sooner gets delayed because of too much WIP. This is known as cost of delay . It’s a concept used to communicate value and urgency—a measure of the impact of time on the outcomes we want, such as customers buying our product this month instead of next month.
WIP is a leading indicator of cycle time. The more items that are worked on at the same time, the more doors open up that allow dependencies and interruptions to creep in.

Flow requires a “do not disturb” ethos. Flow also requires a level of efficiency.

Think of reducing WIP not as limiting but as liberating. The right amount of WIP is what enables us to maintain a healthy amount of work.

Key Takeaways:

- We have a tendency to say yes to any request, regardless of how busy we are.
- Too much WIP prevents us from completing work on time, causes quality to suffer, increases costs, and irritates staff.
- Work-in-progress and cycle time have a relationship. High WIP means that other items sit idle, waiting for attention longer.
- Context switching, which wastes time, is a major consequence of too much WIP. We must learn to say no to additional work when our schedules are full.

### Unknown dependencies

> The definition of freedom is that there is no dependecy.
> Every dependency doubles your chance of being delayed or late.

Let's define dependency.

1. Architecture(both software and hardware)--where change in one area can break another area.
2. Expertise--where counsel or aid from a person with specific know-how is needed to do something
3. Activity--where progress cannot be made until an activity in complete.

If delivery requires every piece being complete, every dependency you remove doubles your chances of delivering on time.

Take a look at this example. If there are two inputs needed to deliver something, then there is only one chance in four of delivering on time. One chance in 2^n is the formula that computes the total number of binary permutations.

When we attempt to increase the performance of individual teams by breaking them down into smaller groups, hidden dangers await if there are unknown dependencies.

We like small teams because they can move fast. Just realize that by moving fast as an individual team, you may be paying the price of not moving very fast as a whole organization.

Key Takeaways:

- It's expensive when teams are unaware of mutually critical information.
- Architecture, expertise, and activities on hold are some of the common dependencies you might run into.
- Every dependency increases the probablity you will be late. If possible, reduce dependencies to save time and money and avoid other complications. Conversely, every dependency you can find and elimate doubles your chances of delivering on time.
- When coordination needs are high, people aren't available when you need them. The same is true for experts--when demand for a skill is high, experts are unavailable.
- When it comes to dependencies, individual team performance can increase to the detriment of company-wide performance.

### Unplanned work

> Code will be used in ways we cannot anticipate, in ways it was never designed for, and for longer than it was ever intended.

This is the problem with unplanned work—it sets back planned work. It increases uncertainty in the system and makes the system less predictable as a result.

sometimes unplanned work comes in the form of a necessary stratefic change in direction, but often, unplanned work comes in the form of unnecessary rework or expedited work requests. These are the fires that stem from some failure.

I am not suggesting all work should be preplanned. It is irrespon-sible (maybe even delusional), to believe that it’s possible to know everything up front while planning a complex project. Quite the contrary—we don’t know much about what we don’t yet know.

A major value of the Agile movement is to encourage responding to change over following a plan. Life is uncertain. Change is inevitable.
Unplanned work is considered a measure of quality because the more unplanned work, the less time for creating value. “All hands on deck” incidents tend to reduce performance and increase variability.

If the work is frequently late, chances are Thief Unplanned Work (i.e., failure demand or strategic change in direction) is stealing not only your time but also your predictability.

Key Takeaways

- Unplanned work adds unpredictability to the system.
- It's all about predictability and expectations for breakfast.
- High-performing companies spend less time working on unplanned work than lower performaing companies.
- Sometimes we have no choice but to drop current projects to focus on urgent unplanned work.
- Unplanned work steals time away from planned work.
- Unplanned work is hard to see, but it can be made visible.

### Conflicting Priorities

> Focus is a matter of deciding what things you are not going to do.

Having a bunch of projects that are sitting at 90% complete does the company no good. Sales can’t sell a feature to a customer if the customer cannot access the feature; features are only valuable if customers can use them.

> Productivity isn't about being a workhorse, keeping busy or burning the midnight oil...It's about priorities and fiercely protecting your time.

Longer cycle times delay the opportunity to receive vital feedback from customers about our work, which in turn creates a crevice for more thievery to sneak in.

If everything is priority one, then nothing is a priority one, and everything takes too long. Many things may be important, but only one can be the most important.

Another indicator conflicting priorities are bogging down your work is when you find yourself spending countless hours in meetings discussing priorities.

Key Takeaways:

- There is one most important thing--let people know what it is.
- Conflicting prioritites occur when people are uncertain on what the highest priority is. This leads too much WIP, which leads to longer cycle times.
- Conflicting priorities that compete for the same people and resources block flow and increase partially completed work.
- What we see as a priority frequently clashes with what others see as a priority.

### Neglected Work

In some ways, aging software is much like an older car that needs regular oil changes and tune-ups to keep it functioning correctly. Old software in itself is not a problem. Old software that is not maintained and is not part of an automated build, test, and deploy process is a problem.

Maintenance of legacy systems is one of the most neglected types of work. The entropy of an isolated system always increases over time. If not repaired or replaced, the system eventually bombs.

> If it hurts, do it more often.
> The current corporate culture that focuses on people being busy all the time is absurd. Work is neglected when people are busy. Busy people, however, do not signal productivity--delivered value does.

When you discover a zombie project, kill it. Kill it so the more important work will be delivered sooner and with fewer interruptions.

> Sunk cost fallacy

The things that matter most must not be sidetracked by the things that matter least.
Business frequently prioritize new feature releases over fixing technical debt. They choose to work on revenue-generating work instead of revenue-protection work.

Takeaways:

- If not dezlt with, important neglected work eventually becomes an emergency.
- Beware of invisible technical debt accruing while teams are sidetracked by short-term Priorities.
- Acknowledge zombie projects. Consider the impact they have on completing high-value projects. Either give them the attention they need or kill them.

## Make Work Visible

These are some examples of team pain:

- Too many interruptions
- Conflicting priorities: everything is a priority one
- Too many meetings
- No time for internal process improvements
- Too many different tools
- Every reorg brings another process method
- Burnout

Business Pain

- Things take too long
- No visibility
- Unpredictable work
- Unaware of problems until its too late
- Simple requests get so complicated

Example of balanced Work Item Types

- Unplanned work
- Maintenance
- Business Requests
- Team Improvements

The people doing the work should always be involved with designing their workflow management system for two reasons:

1. It helps ensure you have the right number and types of categories that cover the needs and demand of your entire team
2. When people participate in creating something, they have ownership, which motivates them to invest in solving problems and achieving

For instance, if you have a to-do list that looks like it's the size of War & Peace, then you maybe asking if you really need to put everything on your board? No, you do not. The question becomes, what do you trim? Some things are so low on the priority list that it doesn’t make sense to clutter your To Do column with them because that will distract you from the most important work. Also, by the time you finish your top three to five priority items, your next set of priorities will probably have changed.

Key Takeaways for Unplanned work

- There will always be unplanned work, therefore ylu should plan for unplanned work
- Knowing the ratio of unplanned work to planned work helps you plan workload capcity
- Size doesn't really matter when it comes to WIP limits--it doesn't matter how big or how small a chunk of work is when you truly focus on just one thing at a time.
- A consistent time and place for office hours and do not disturb hours helps to minimize the damage from unplanned work.

> Many things may be important, but only one can be the most important.

There are several ways to prioritize.

- Highest paid person's opinion(HIPPO)
- Cost of delay (CoD): A way of communicating value and urgency, CoD is a measure of the impact of time on the outcomes we want. This is an excellent approach for determining business risk, but difficult for many people to actually do. Cost of Delay combines urgency and value--two things that human are not very good at distingushing between. To make decisions, we need to understand not just how valuable something is, but how urgent it is. “What value is lost by the delay of something? How much will we lose if we deliver this thing twelve months later?”
  - Reduced revenue or business value.
  - Increased costs.
  - The sum of the CoD of other work that is dependent on the work we are calculating CoD for
- FIFO.
- Weighted shortest job first (WSJF), gives preference to the shortest job with the highest CoD.

Many organizations are blind to the queue problem. They tend to focus on resource efficiency intead of applying systems thinking to improve the efficiency of the whole system, end to end.

Takeaways:

- People take on more WIP when they are unclear on priorities. Establish an explicit prioritization policy to avoid too much WIP.
- Think about the line of commitment. Bring clear visibility to work that is prioritized and fully committed but, if completing with other projects, will increase its cost of delay.

> Never let something important become urgent.

## Metrics, Feedback and Circumstances

### Your metrics or your money

> Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.

Some of the best metrics that show actual progress (or lack thereof) are lead time, cycle time, WIP, and aging reports.

Key Takeaways

- Delays are common; use metrics, particularly flow metrics, to help you make good decisions on priorities, WIP limits and capcity utilization
- Stop letting yourslef and your team reach 100% capcity utilization
- Look for the optimal batch size to help you achieve efficiency while keeping transaction costs down

### The Time Thief O'Gram

The CIOs I have talked to want two things: less risk and more predictability. The time thief O'gram shows you that. It shows risk (uncertainties) with respect to unplanned work, neglected work, conflicting priorities, and unknown dependencies.

> Let the flow manage the processes, and not let management manage the flow.

Key Takeaways:

- Good metrics for operations reviews include throughput, flow time, and time theft along with issues and blocked items.
- Track metrics over time so that you can see what improvements have been made or still need to be made.

### Meetings

Stand-up

- What work is blocked? (Unknown dependency)
- What work is at risk of becoming blocked? (Competing priorities)
- Is there work being done that isn't on the board? (unplanned work)

### Beastly Practices

Correlating activity with business value is risky. High activity levels do not equate to high business value. High activity levels equate to hidden queues, which contribute to teams finishing projects late. Using a time sheet to track the number of hours Todd spent work-ing on a task does not reflect the speed of delivered business value.

Best practices have their place, particularly when it comes to simple routine tasks, but it’s often a better idea to conduct your own experiments to discover what truly works for your situation and organization. When cause and effect are unknown, there is no BEST PTACTICE!
