# Competing with Unicorns

Startup

- a small company numbering no more than fifty people, armed with little more than an idea or insight, and looking to take on the world through an innovative product or service.

startups iterate, are super-focused on product, and put a premium on learning. Ask any traditional company if they value these things and they will undoubtedly say: "Yes. Of course we do!" But if you watch their actions, you will see they don't.
No longer is software development about time, dates, and budgets. Now it is all about the customer, impact, and learning.
Unicorns out-trust and -empower teams when compared to traditional companies. And it shows in the quality of the work, and the quality of the product.

Here the focus is more on automating in-house systems all in the name of productivity and efficiency. With known requirements, in-house customers, and relatively few unknowns, the focus here is more around managing expectations, predictability, and planning.

Enterprise software delivery is largely an inwardly facing exercise in system automation. The customer is known. The requirements are known. And even if there are details to be worked out, there’s an existing system the team can study to figure out what to automate. Discovery isn’t valued here. Sticking to the plan is.

Something that works:

- Gives teams an incentive to think longer-term
- Gives teams the time and space to explore
- Lets them incorporate learnings as they go
- Puts the focus back on the work
- Values impact over conformance to plan

Mission is driven from bottom up
Work with the headcount they’ve got, and do as much as they can with the resources given.

- from mission to how

### continously iterating

That means periodically doing the same story multiple times, each time collecting more data, through which comes better insight—and then ultimately triangulating toward a better solution. All things enterprises typically don’t do when executing through a project.

This is a subtle but important point—while leadership sets the mission, the team gets to decide how to get there. And one of the instruments they use for showing how they intend to do that is the backlog.

### Empowering through squads

You’ll see how tech companies make better decisions, require fewer handoffs, and simplify the coordination of work with others—ultimately enabling everyone to go faster.

Great product takes countless iterations. And the experimentation necessary to figure out how to make the product better can’t be handed off to another team. They need to maintain and iterate on the product themselves.

Be autonomous, but don't suboptimize.
Do your work—but not at the expense of others. Review other teams’ pull requests (PRs—changes to code), put your work on hold periodically to help other important initiatives, and work for the greater company good—not just what’s best for your squad.

- With the recent changes made, can the team now release more quickly into production?
- it’s up to the squad to decide what’s good enough and when to ship. This ensures teams have enough time to test. Enough time to debug. And enough time to build it right.
- Being autonomous means being able to take a longer-term view, to empower teams to balance the countless trade-offs that come with delivery. This is how tech companies empower and trust.

None of this stuff works without empowerment and trust. If you want teams to make their own decisions, become accountable, and go that extra mile, you need to trust them. It’s that simple.
The second you signal that you don’t trust a team, or that they’re not empowered to solve their own problems, they won’t. They’ll sit back and wait for you to hand them a project and tell them what to do.

As Steve Jobs once said: “It doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.”

#### Let them make mistakes.

This does two things. One, it signals that it’s OK to make mistakes. It’s part of the game. Two, it signals that you trust them, and you’ve got their back.

What decisions can't you team make, that would be necessary for them to take full responsibility for aspects of the delivery?

### Scale with Tribes

The power of learning, and feeling yourself continuously getting better, is highly attractive to hard-working, smart, intelligent people. It’s what keeps your best and brightest sticking around.

Pushing decisions down as far as you can encourages people to self-organize.

Squads focus on the What. Chapters faciliate the How.

### Align with Bets

DIBBS are used to decide and debate.

- Data, a point or set of points about the relationship between our constituents and iterations of our product, content, business model, or the world.
- Insight, a learning, theory or conclusion drawn from one or more data points.
- A hypothesis built on one or more insights that offers direction to a team or teams.
- A decision to test a belief or set of related beliefs in practice by establishing it as a goal and dedicatting resouces to it.

### Working at a tech lead company

When you tell people what to do, they don't own it. You do. "Come to me if you lack information, context, or have bigger-picture questions. This is something you need to work out among yourselves. I am not going to tell you what to do. "

### Invest in productivity

gold plating?? Release train??

### Learn with data

The mechanics of the A/B test and the feature flag are almost the same. The difference with the A/B test is you need an extra mechanism to decide what portion of users you want to direct to your new design.

### Reinforce through culture

Belief about teams

- What you can become matters more than what you are.
  - whoever learns the fastest wins.
  - It is a marathon, not a sprint.
  - Strong teams outperform strong individuals.
- The biggest leaps forward happen when different perspectives and viewpoints collide.

Team-based consensus-driven approaches to work and problem solving are how Swedes like to work—which is why agile software delivery comes naturally to Swedes. They were already working that way.
